# Sparkling: multimodal distributed auto clustering

## What is it

The aim of this framework is to provide user-friendly interface to solve hard clustering problem.

**Sparkling** is based on Apache Spark, e.g., is applicable to process huge distributed datasets.

Framework implements its own data preprocessor and introduces three novel features:

* Multimodal data support (any combination of tabular, image and text);
* Automatic quality optimisation by means of reinforcement learning and bayes optimisation;
* Measure (cluster validity index, CVI) recommendation based on meta-learning method.
