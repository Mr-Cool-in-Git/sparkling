### ITMO authors

It was necessary to group university professors whose vector representations of 
scientific interests were obtained in a special way. 

Clustering was required to assess the effectiveness of vectorization: the authors of 
the methodology believed that only in an acceptable vector representation clustering 
algorithms will be able to group university employees in such a way that employees working 
in the same field of knowledge with similar research directions would end up in the same groups.
